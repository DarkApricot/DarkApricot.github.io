        <h2>This is project Winter Wonder Ride!</h2>
        <h3>For this project we had 4-5 weeks with 2 developers (me being one of them) and 3 artists. We had 3 sprints total and managed to get a lot more done in the last sprint than expected, so the difference is quite hilarious.<br>In this project I made the menu's / UI, obstacles and general finetuning.</h3>

                        <h3>This sprint was quite a mess, but we managed to get a good start. The beginning of the menu was there + general layout. Max, the other developer of this project, had started the movement of the car and we already had a checkpoint system.<br><br>
                        The car movement is still very wonky and was practically impossible to drive, and everyone hit every obstacle possible as if they were drawn to it. ðŸ˜‚ The art also had a good base, and the blockout of the map was practically finished at this point.</h3>

                        I had made icicle obstacles that dropped once you were close enough, which made everyone be stuck in the cave for a few minutes. The artists were already working on texturing of models and the menu had a few small updates here and there.</h3>

The main and gameplay menus are completely finished with a scoreboard and checks so you can see how you did compared to the other saved files.<br><br>
                        We added more obstacles: snowballs rolling down in the cave, snowpiles you have to avoid and the spikes falling were reworked. The map was now massive and with the finished power-ups much more fun to play!</h3>

                        I saved strings with specific information to numbers associated with each file. For example, names were saved in a string with "nameFile" + fileNumber, cars with "whichCar" + "file" (nameFile + fileNumber), and so on.</h3>

To address this, I created a scriptable object for each file. I spawned them with the correct visuals and named the objects by their deltaTime float value so I could sort the objects based on their names. I then displayed them in the UI according to the sorted array.</h3>
